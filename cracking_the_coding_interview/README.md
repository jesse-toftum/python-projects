This is a fantastic book, and I'm going to attempt to go through some portions 
of it with a mature, Pythonic approach. Names of the solutions are taken from 
the name of the question. Some questions may have multiple answers. While some
testing has been done to ensure accuracy, only the examples included in Cracking
The Coding Interview are printed in each Python file, and only if one is given.
