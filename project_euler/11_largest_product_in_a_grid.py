Project Euler Statement for Problem 11:

In the 20x20 grid below, four numbers along a diagonal line have been marked in red.
(See 11_image.png, 11_numbers.txt)

The product of these numbers is 26 * 63 * 78 * 14 = 1788696.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction
(up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20x20 grid?
